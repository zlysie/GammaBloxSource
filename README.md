# GammaBlox Source

Hi, I'm putting this out there since I don't really care enough about this anymore and I'm definitely not coming back to work on it.
I've included the database schema and rendermanager (Requires Java 8)

I don't have source right now for the rendermanager so it will just be the jar.

I've included the client and rccservice used during production. Please be aware that because it's 2008, it's insecure regardless of how many patches I've done so I'd recommend you to enforce it better or something.

ALSO, to make sure users can play games on the client, make sure to install it thru InstallShield with TypeLib reg keys as to populate the registery required to make it work.

I cannot guarantee that this will result in a great experience with everything now on display.

Lastly,

## MAKE SURE TO CREDIT ME FOR THE SOURCE IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO REHOST GAMMA / MODIFY IT FOR YOUR OWN REVIVAL.

I just realised that windows may have merged some folders around sooo sorry not sorry!!
